## Module 1

### What is Cloud Computing?
Cloud computing is the on-demand delivery of IT resources over the Internet with pay-as-you-go pricing. Instead of buying, owning, and maintaining physical data centers and servers, you can access technology services, such as computing power, storage, and databases, on an as-needed basis from a cloud provider like Amazon Web Services (AWS).

- Database installation etc. is not a core differentiator for business
    - repetitive tasks common to many businesses - no point in the business itself maintaining this
    - instead outsource this to cloud and concentrate on your core business development

### Deployment Models for Cloud Computing
While selecting a cloud stratgy, factors a company should consider (non-exhaustive)
    - What cloud application components are needed?
    - Preferred resource management tools
    - Legacy IT infra requirements

### Cloud computing models
- Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)
- Platform as a Service (PaaS)
- Software as a Service (SaaS)
    - Software as a Service provides you with a completed product that is run and managed by the service provider
    - In most cases, people referring to Software as a Service are referring to end-user applications
    - With a SaaS offering you do not have to think about how the service is maintained or how the underlying infrastructure is managed

### Cloud computing deployment models
- cloud-based
    - Run all parts of the application in the cloud.
    - Migrate existing applications to the cloud.
    - Design and build new applications in the cloud.
- on-premises (aka private cloud)
    - Though this model is much like legacy IT infrastructure, its incorporation of application management and virtualization technologies helps to increase resource utilization.
- hybrid
    - Connect cloud-based resources to on-premises infrastructure
    - Integrate cloud-based resources with legacy IT applications
    - For example, you have legacy applications that are better maintained on premises, or government regulations require your business to keep certain records on premises.

### Benefits of cloud computing
- Trade upfront expense for variable expense
- Stop spending money to run and maintain data centers
- Stop guessing capacity
- Benefit from massive economies of scale
- Increase speed and agility (enables you to access new resources within minutes)
- Go global in minutes
    - Easily deploy your application in multiple regions around the world with just a few clicks
