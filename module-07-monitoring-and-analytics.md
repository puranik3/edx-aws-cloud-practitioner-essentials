## Module 7: Monitoring and Analytics
- continuously observing the system in action, automatically collecting/generating metrics, and using it as feedback to take immediate and necessary corrective action
- we monitor AWS resources to take action when needed
    - if EC2 instances are overloaded, we detect it and automatically scale up
    - if an application sends error responses frequently, we can alert someone to take a look into it
