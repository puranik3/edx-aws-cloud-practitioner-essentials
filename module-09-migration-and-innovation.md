## Module 9: Migration and Innovation
Moving from on-premise data centers to AWS cloud

### AWS Cloud Adoption Framework (AWS CAF)
- Organizes guidance into 6 __Perspectives__ (_areas of focus_)
    - each perspective addresses a distinct responsibility
    - so the right people across the organization prepare for the changes ahead
    - the __Business__, __People__, and __Governance__ Perspectives focus on _business capabilities_
    - the __Platform__, __Security__, and __Operations__ Perspectives focus on _technical capabilities_
- __Business Perspective__
    - ensures that IT aligns with business needs and that IT investments link to key business results
    - use CAF to create a strong business case for cloud adoption and prioritize cloud adoption initiatives
    - Common roles
        - Business managers
        - Finance managers
        - Budget owners
        - Strategy stakeholders

    - CAF helps these stakeholders define current operating procedures and identify the process changes and training needed to implement successful cloud adoption
    - Common roles
        - IT operations managers
        - IT support managers
- Each perspective is used to uncover gaps in the organization's skills and processes
    - These gaps act as inputs to create an __AWS CAF Action Plan__ that helps guide the organization for AWS Cloud migration


### Migration Process
- These are generally the 5 phases in the cloud migration process
    - Opportunity Evaluation
    - Portfolio Discovery and Planning
    - Application Design
    - Migration & Validation
    - Operation

### Migration Strategies
- These are 6 most common migration strategies that you can implement when migrating to the cloud
- __6 Strategies for Migration__
    - __Rehosting__
        - __lift-and-shift__
        - moving applications without changes
        - eg. a large legacy migration
            - helps migrate and scale quickly to meet a business case (say, save costs)
    - __Replatforming__
        - __lift, tinker, and shift__
        - making a few cloud optimizations to realize a tangible benefit
        - optimization is achieved without changing the core architecture of the application
        - eg. reducing the amount of time you spend managing database instances by migrating to a database-as-a-service platform like Amazon RDS, or migrating the app to a managed platform like Amazon Elastic Beanstalk
    - __Repurchasing__
        - moving from a traditional license to a Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) model
        - eg. a business might choose to implement the repurchasing strategy by migrating from a CRM system to Salesforce.com
    - __Refactoring/re-architecting__
        - reimagining how an application is architected and developed by using cloud-native features
        - driven by a strong business need to add features, scale, or performance that would otherwise be difficult to achieve in the application's existing environment
        - eg. migrating from a monolithic architecture to a service-oriented (or serverless) architecture to boost agility or improve business continuity
        - tends to be the most expensive, but may also be the most beneficial
    - __Retaining__
        - don't move to AWS Cloud yet!
        - keeping applications that are critical for the business in the source environment
        - might include applications that require major refactoring before they can be migrated, or, work that can be postponed until a later time
    - __Retiring__
        - don't move to AWS Cloud
        - in fact, remove applications that are no longer needed even from the source environment!

### AWS Snow Family Members
- transporting large amounts of data __into__ and __out of__ AWS can take a very long time
    - eg. A network of 1 Gbps speed moves 1 PB of data about 100 days (and likely longer)
    - this is both time-consuming, and costly!
- __AWS Snow Family Members__
- a collection of physical devices that help to physically transport up to exabytes of data __into__ and __out of__ AWS
    - different capacity points
    - include different levels of built-in computing capabilities
    - optimize for space-constrained or weight-constrained environments
    - optimize for portability
    - flexible networking options
    - data moved to AWS Snow Family devices is automatically encrypted with 256-bit encryption keys that are managed by AWS KMS
    - once received at the AWS data center, AWS verifies and copies the data (usually an S3 bucket)
    - once the data migration job is complete and verified, AWS performs a secure software erasure of the device
- __these devices have computing resources so as to collect and process data at the edge__
    - they fit into existing server racks at AWS data centers
    - devices can support Amazon EC2 instances, AWS IoT Greengrass functions, and Kubernetes deployments on Amazon EKS Anywhere
    - once plugged in on these server racks, you can run EC2 instances on them, cluster them, run lambda functions etc.!
    - customers usually ship these devices to remote locations where computing is not available but needed
        - eg. capturing of streams from IoT devices
        - industrial signalling
        - image compression
        - video transcoding
- __Three types__
    - __AWS Snowcone__
        - small, rugged, and secure edge computing and data transfer device
        - features 2 CPUs, 4 GB of memory, and 8 TB of usable storage
    - __AWS Snowball__
        - __Snowball Edge Storage Optimized devices__ 
            - well-suited for
                - large-scale data migrations
                - recurring transfer workflows
                - local computing with higher capacity needs
            - provides 40 vCPUs, and 80 GB of RAM, __80TB HDD__ or __210TB NVMe__ capacity for Amazon S3-compatible object storage (the 210TB device only supports data migration use cases)
        - __Snowball Edge Compute Optimized devices__
            - provide powerful computing resources
            - well-suited for
                - machine learning
                - full motion video analysis
                - analytics
                - local computing stacks
            - __104 vCPUs__, an __optional NVIDIA Tesla V100 GPU__, __416 GiB of memory__, 28 TB usable NVMe SSD capacity for Amazon S3 compatible storage or EBS-compatible block volumes. Snowball Edge Compute Optimized devices run Amazon EC2 sbe-c and sbe-g instances, which are equivalent to C5, M5a, G3, and P3 instances
    - __AWS Snowmobile__
        - an exabyte-scale data transfer service used to move large amounts of data to AWS.
        - transfer up to __100 petabytes__ of data per Snowmobile, a 45-foot long ruggedized shipping container, pulled by a semi trailer truck
